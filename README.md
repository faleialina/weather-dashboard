1. *Frontend with React:*
   - We'll use *React.js* to build the user interface.
   - React allows efficient updates to the page content when data changes.

2. *HTTP Requests with Axios:*
   - To fetch temperature data, we'll use *Axios*.

3. *Displaying Data:*
   - We'll create components to display temperature for various cities.
   - Data will be loaded from the API via Axios and shown on the page.

4. *City Search:*
   - We'll add an input field where users can enter a city name.
   - Upon entering a city, we'll make a request to the server and retrieve temperature data for that city.

5. *Building with Vite:*
   - For project bundling, we'll use *Vite*.
